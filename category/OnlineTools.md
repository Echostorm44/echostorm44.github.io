title: Online Tools
---

These are online tools that I've been using for long enough to recommend.

#### File Transfer

- **[FilePizza](https://file.pizza/)** - This is a clever little file send that uses WebRTC to send files peer-to-peer.  Files are encrypted and you can password protect them. The file is gone after you close the tab.

#### Meme Creation

- **[ImgFlip](https://imgflip.com/memetemplates)** - The best online meme generator I've found.  Tons of templates, easy to use interface, and you can create an account to save your memes.
