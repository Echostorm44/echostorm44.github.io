title: Online Tools
---

These are online tools that I've been using for long enough to recommend.

#### Unicode

- **[Symbl](https://symbl.cc/)** - Great site for lookup up unicode characters.
- **[Character Map](https://charactermap.org/#emojis)** - Another great unicode character lookup site.

#### Diagrams

- **[DrawIO](https://www.draw.io/index.html)** - This is a great online tool for creating diagrams. It has a simple interface and supports a wide range of diagram types.
- **[MermaidViewer.com](https://www.mermaidviewer.com/)** - A pretty good free Mermaid live editor.
- **[Mermaid-drawing.com](https://mermaid-drawing.com/)** - Another pretty good Mermain live editor

#### Markdown

- **[stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#)** - An almost perfect online markdown editor. 


#### Regex & Text Manipulation

- **[Regex Storm](http://regexstorm.net/tester/)** - Great site for testing and debugging C# regular expressions.
- **[Regex 101](https://regex101.com/)** - Another great site for testing and debugging regular expressions in lesser languages :wink:.
- **[Nimble Text](https://nimbletext.com/)** - A great online text manipulation tool that supports regex replacements, case changes, sorting, and more.

#### Conversion Tools	

- **[json2csharp](https://json2csharp.com/)** - Great site for converting JSON to C# classes.


#### Online Compilers / Pens

- **[DotNet Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/)** - This is a pretty great online C# compiler, it allows for using different version of .net and Nuget Packages
- **[Rex Tester](https://rextester.com/)** - This is a decent fallback with less features than Dotnet Fiddle but supports lots of lesser langauges :wink:
- **[Code Pen](https://codepen.io/pen/)** - Nice for HTML / CSS / JS all together and for sharing snippets.

#### File Transfer

- **[FilePizza](https://file.pizza/)** - This is a clever little file send that uses WebRTC to send files peer-to-peer.  Files are encrypted and you can password protect them. The file is gone after you close the tab.

#### Meme Creation

- **[ImgFlip](https://imgflip.com/memetemplates)** - The best online meme generator I've found.  Tons of templates, easy to use interface, and you can create an account to save your memes.

#### Shopping

- **[CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/)** - The best Amazon price tracker I've found.  It shows price history charts and can alert you when prices drop.

#### Music

- **[Tune Find](https://www.tunefind.com/)** - The best site for finding music from your favorite TV shows and movies.  Just enter the show or movie name and it will show you all the songs used in it.
