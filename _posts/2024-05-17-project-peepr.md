# Peepr
Peepr is a simple image and video viewer for windows.  I created Peepr because I often have folders with a mish mash of images and videos of all formats and if I want to browse through them all at once I have to use an image viewer like ImageGlass and then open the videos with VLC and forget doing a slideshow with everything.

So I made Peepr to handle everything itself. It was also a good excuse to try building with AvaloniaUI which I recommend.

## Features
- Supports all common image formats
- Supports all common video formats (It uses VLC's library)
- Navigate using arrow buttons, keyboard arrow keys or forward / back buttons on your mouse 
- Slideshow! (Delay configurable)
- Escape to close
- Delete to delete file
- Optional associate Images and or Videos with Peepr

## Simplicity
Peepr is designed to be simple. If you want to edit your images, use an image editor that is built for that.  Peepr is just for peeping. ;)

## Installation
In the release section either download the install.exe or the Peepr.zip
Both run as portable but the installer is just a little simpler and puts a shortcut on your desktop.
If you download the zip, extract it to a folder of your choice and run Peepr.exe
