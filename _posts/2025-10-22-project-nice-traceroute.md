# NiceTraceRoute

I've had cause to use the tracert that comes with Windows over the past week and I found myself thinking, "This could be nicer".  So I made a nice version that is better about letting you know that stuff is happening.  It is setup to AOT compile and trim so it doesn't require any .net installed and weighs in at a flattering 3.5 MB.
